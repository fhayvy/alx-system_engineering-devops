Postmortem: WEB APPLICATION 500 ERROR INCIDENT

Issue Summary:

Duration: August 17, 2024, 14:30 - 17:45 UTC

Impact: Users experienced 500 Internal Server Errors when accessing our main web application. Approximately 85% of users were affected.

Root Cause: A misconfigured Nginx reverse proxy following a recent update.


Timeline:

14:30 - Issue detected through automated monitoring alert showing a spike in 500 errors.
14:35 - Engineering team began investigation, focusing on application servers.
15:00 - Application logs showed no errors; team shifted focus to database servers.
15:30 - Database investigation yielded no results; team began examining network infrastructure.
16:00 - Incident escalated to senior engineering team and DevOps.
16:30 - DevOps identified misconfiguration in Nginx reverse proxy.
17:30 - Fix implemented and tested in staging environment.
17:45 - Fix deployed to production, service restored.


Root Cause and Resolution:
The root cause was traced to a misconfiguration in the Nginx reverse proxy settings. During a routine update, a change was made to the proxy_pass directive in the Nginx configuration file. This change incorrectly routed requests to a non-existent upstream server, resulting in 500 errors for users.
The issue was resolved by correcting the proxy_pass directive in the Nginx configuration file to point to the correct upstream application server. After testing in a staging environment, the corrected configuration was deployed to production, immediately resolving the issue.


Corrective and Preventative Measures:
To prevent similar incidents in the future, we will implement the following measures:

1. Improve change management processes:

Implement stricter review procedures for configuration changes.
Require peer reviews for all infrastructure modifications.


2. Enhance monitoring and alerting:

Set up more granular monitoring for Nginx configuration and performance.
Implement alerts for sudden increases in 5xx errors.


3. Improve documentation:

Create and maintain up-to-date documentation for all critical infrastructure components.
Develop a runbook for common issues, including reverse proxy misconfigurations.


4. Enhance testing procedures:

Implement automated tests for critical infrastructure components.
Expand staging environment to more closely mirror production.


5. Training and knowledge sharing:

Conduct training sessions on Nginx configuration and best practices.
Schedule regular knowledge sharing sessions among team members.



TODO List:

1. Update Nginx configuration management process to require peer review.
2. Implement Nginx configuration syntax checking in CI/CD pipeline.
3. Set up Prometheus monitoring for Nginx with custom alerts for 5xx errors.
4. Create comprehensive documentation for our Nginx setup and configuration.
5. Develop and document a procedure for safe Nginx configuration updates.
6. Schedule a team training session on Nginx reverse proxy configuration.
7. Implement automated tests to verify correct Nginx behavior post-updates.
8. Review and update incident response procedures to include Nginx-specific checks.
